/* This method will load the graphics for the non-background stuff (similarly like Background.java) such as the paddles or the ball. Since I'm not planning on having too many
 * assets, I won't make separate spritesheets neither in the code nor in the files. The few amount of assets I actually need for this project will probably be stored in separate
 * image files which will be processed as sprites here in this class. Those sprites can be than used in the Player method(s?) and with the ball.
